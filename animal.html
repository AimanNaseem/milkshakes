            <h2 class="to">African Penguins</h2>
            <p>They’re cute. They walk funny. They’re flightless. But these little guys sure can swim. They’re African penguins and you can find them at their 17,000 gallon oasis known as Penguin Island at Marine Aquarium, where you can watch them swim, frolic and dive by our underwater viewing window. Standing about 12 inches high, African penguins can eat up to 20% of their body weight in just one sitting and are one of 18 penguin species worldwide. Of those 18 species, only 7 live where it’s cold and African penguins are NOT one of them! They prefer more moderate climates. As such – it’s somewhat surprising to people that of ALL penguins live south of the Equator.</p>

            <p>The sand tiger shark is a large, slow-moving shark notable for its jagged teeth and menacing appearance. This shark looks fierce as it slowly swims with its mouth open and needle-like teeth exposed. Despite this, it is a relatively placid shark that has rarely been implicated in unprovoked attacks on people. It is found living close to the shorelines and sandy beaches of North America.</p>

            <p>Green turtles live all over the world and can be found off the coasts of more than 140 countries.Green turtles are 3 to 4 feet (91 to 122 cm) long and weigh 300 to 350 pounds (136 to 159 kg).
                Green Sea Turtles! The green sea turtle is a sea turtle, possessing a body covered by a large, teardrop-shaped shell and a pair of large, paddle-like flippers.

            <h2 class="to">Sea Horse</h2>
            <p>One of the most fascinating and delicate creatures in the animal kingdom. Seahorses are fish, though they are also closely related to pipefish and sea dragons. They do not have scales like most other fish, but rather have bony plates just below the skin that act like a suit of armor. Seahorses are weak swimmers, and their prehensile tail allows them to hold onto grass or rocks so that they won't be swept away. Many seahorses can change color to camouflage with their surroundings. Some species even develop fleshy tabs on their skin to help them hide. When eating, the seahorse's long snout acts like a powerful straw, sucking prey into its mouth.</p>

            <h2 class="to">Jelly Fish</h2>
            <p>Jellyfish ancestors first appeared 500 million years ago and were the first animals known to swim using muscles instead of drifting with ocean waves and currents. Jellies excel at surviving because of their broad diets, rapid reproductive capabilities and tolerance for degraded habitats in water with little oxygen. In fact, a jellyfish’s tolerance allows for this animal to thrive in polluted waters causing them to cause chaos by clogging fishing nets, forcing power plants to shut down and preventing beach goers from swimming at your favorite beaches.</p>

            <p>Horseshoe crabs are comprised of a hard shelled body with two large compound eyes and multiple smaller simple ones atop the carapace.Female horseshoe crab are about one-third larger than the males. They can grow to be 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 centimeters) from head to tail, while the males are approximately 14 to 15 inches (36 to 38 centimeters).</p>

            <h2 class="to">Commonclown Fish</h2>
            <p>Clownfish are famous for their symbiotic relationship with anemones. Anemones, related to jellyfish, have the ability to sting animals that touch their tentacles. However, clownfish have protective slime that covers their bodies so that the anemones do not sting them. The anemone therefore inadvertently protects the clownfish from other species that would otherwise try to prey on the clownfish. Clownfish are popular home aquarium inhabitants and have become more popular due to the movie Finding Nemo.</p>

            <h2 class="to">American Lobster</h2>
            <p>The American lobster, also known as the Atlantic lobster, is the largest species of lobster. Depending on its diet, genetics and exposure to light, its color can vary from greenish brown to bright blue.American lobsters typically have 10 legs, two with large claws of different sizes. The larger claw is used to crush; the smaller claw is used to rip. A lobster can easily snap a pencil or even a finger once in the grasp of the crusher claw. Lobsters can be either right or left handed, so some lobsters have the crushing claw on the right while others have it on the left. Scientists estimate that American lobsters may live as long as 100 years, but no one has yet figured out a way to accurately tell a lobster's age.</p>

            <p>See one of the coolest and exotic of the deep ocean creatures: The giant Pacific octopus.Many people are fans of the octopus, but few realize what an amazing animal it truly is. The giant Pacific octopus is one of the largest kinds of octopus in the world. An octopus mouth has a parrot-like beak, which it uses to crack open crabs and other hard-shelled animals. That beak is the only hard part of an octopus body; the rest is soft and squishy. Remarkably, an octopus can squeeze through any opening that's bigger than its beak.</p>
